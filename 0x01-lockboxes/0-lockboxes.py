    The function `canUnlockAll` checks if all the boxes in a given list can
    be unlocked by using the keys inside the boxes.

    :param boxes: The parameter "boxes" is a list of lists. Each inner
                  list represents a box, and the indices of the inner
                  list represent the keys that can open that box.
                  For example, if boxes[0] = [1,2], it means that the
                  first box can be opened with keys 1 and 2.
    :return: a boolean value. It returns True if all the boxes
             can be unlocked, and False otherwise.
